# Free Pizza!

Pizza Hut have yet again caught onto our tomfoolery and decided to switch things up. It seems like they are using different codes for different stores, and so far it looks like these codes do use the existing random logic, but are prepended by different numbers now, like 5 and 8, instead of just 2. I have added these to the site - feel free to let me know how it goes for you and if you find some other codes that work for your store.
